### When?
When we are bored of our works and we want to rest, to speak with each other, to know something new from our friends from all over the city.

### Where and how?
It's all up to you. We can sit at a bar, drink beer, smoke hookah and discuss in parallel about JS frameworks. 🍻

But we are not adepts of an alcohol because it destructs our expensive brains 💩, so we can choose something more healthy. Feel free to suggest place and activity. 👍

### What do I need?
You need nothing except a wish to communicate with colleagues. Actually, a little bit of money will be very helpful. :)

If you have to demonstrate something or to ask for help with your project, you can bring a laptop. 👨‍💻 If you are not worried that it can be drowned in beer, of course.

### Feedback
You can create an issue in this repo.

### ⚠️ Remember, the main purpose of this event is not to get drunk, but to share the experience.
